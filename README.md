## Overview
This project serves as a supplementary agent in our research on Gamma-ray burst optical progenitors. We search random areas around a potential precursor candidate, and create a visualization of TESScut's full-frame images. In these "movies" we are looking for an optical flash that resembles the original candidate's (similar length, brightness). So far we have made 10 movies and the plan is to perform 100 tests for verification.

## Results Methodology
1. The results of this analysis are obtained by observing short "movies" created from TESScut images.

1. TESScut image contains a "flash" based on the following criteria:
    1. Independence: a flash is independent of any nearby stars or instrument anomoly.
    1. Time: a flash lasts only 1-2 frames.
  
1. An image is determined to be a valid candidate for a test based on the following:
